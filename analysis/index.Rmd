# Introduction to Logica
Logica (LOcal GenetIc Correlation across Ancestries) is a new method specifically designed to estimate local genetic correlations across ancestries. Logica employs a bivariate linear mixed model that explicitly accounts for diverse LD patterns across ancestries, operates on GWAS summary statistics, and utilizes a maximum likelihood framework for robust inference.
